## Contributers
A project by [@amberchunn](https://github.com/amberchunn) & [@fabiankaegy](https://github.com/fabiankaegy). Created as an entry for the [javascriptforwp](https://javascriptforwp.com) hackathon early 2019.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run deploy`

Takes the contents of the build directory and pushes them to the `gh-pages` branch. This will result in the site being deployed to the url: [https://fabiankaegy.github.io/acfk-meal-planning/](https://fabiankaegy.github.io/acfk-meal-planning/).

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
